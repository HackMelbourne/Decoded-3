## 0. Create a Discord Account and Discord Server
* Before creating our bot, please make sure you create a Discord Account (it's free!) and a Discord Server to test your bot in
### Create a Discord Account

### Create a Discord Server
> üìù NOTE: Discord servers are sometimes refered to as **'guilds'** in some documentation (because some people confuse the word 'server' with computer servers üóÑÔ∏è XD)

## 1. Create an Application
* [Applications Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## 2. Installing Modules: `discord.py` and `python-dotenv`
  * Before we begin creating the bot, we have to install a few modules
  * Install `discord.py`
    * discord.py is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord - basically, this is what allows us to connects our code with Discord (TODO someone can rephrase what an API is lol)
    * to install it, type this into your terminal:
      ```
      pip install -U discord.py
      ```
  * Install `python-dotenv`
    * `python-dotenv` is used to access our secret Discord token, which we will store in a `.env` file
    * to install it, type this into your terminal:
      ```
      pip install -U python-dotenv
      ```
  * Let us know if you run into any errors during installation!

## 3. Creating a Bot and Adding it to your server

### Environment Variables
* TODO Why we need environment variables: danger of leaving your keys around
  ```python
  # ./main.py (after the other imports)
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  TOKEN = os.getenv('TOKEN')
  ```
* ‚úÖ Create a `.env` and 

* TODO adding it to your server
## 4. Make the Bot say "Hello, World!"
* TODO Slides/Explanation: what are decorators?
* TODO Slides/Explanation: what are events and callbacks - what is async and await (extension)
  ```python
  # 

  ```
* ‚úÖ 

<details>
<summary><b>‚ùì What are events?</b></summary>

Events are exactly as you would think, stuff that happens that we want to know about. Examples would be someone joining a server, sending a message, or reacting to something.

To 'hook' onto an event, we use a decorator on a function call:
```python
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
  ...
```
The function name tells discord.py what event we're listening to (in this case, messages).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>‚ùì What is <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>?</b></summary>

  Often in coding, you will need to perform a task, and wait for the response before you can do anything. An example would be Gmail, the website needs to wait for the mail to send, before telling you it's sent.
  Using `async` on a function lets Python know that this task involves waiting for something:
  ```python
  async def send_mail():
    await login()
    await send()
  ```
  and `await` tells Python to wait for an `async` function to finish before proceeding:
  ```python
  await send_mail()
  print("Your mail was sent!")
  # As opposed to
  send_mail()
  print("This will be printed immediately")
  ```
  In the context of discord.py, we can use `async` on our functions to tell discord.py it's going to do a long-running task, and `await` to do that task:
  ```python
  async def on_join(self, ctx):
    await ctx.send("Welcome to the server!")
  ```

## 5. Adding Commands
* 

## 6. Cogs
* TODO Slides/Explanation: what and why of [cogs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html)

  ```python
  # ./main.py
  from discord.ext import commands
  import os

  client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "!")

  # Looks inside the /cogs/ folder and loads up all of our cogs
  for filename in os.listdir("./cogs"):
      if filename.endswith(".py"):
          client.load_extension("cogs." + filename[:-3])

  client.run(TOKEN)
  ```

  ```python
  # ./cogs/test.py
  from discord.ext import commands

  class Test(commands.Cog):
      def __init__(self, client):
          self.client = client

      @commands.Cog.listener() # this is a decorator for events/listeners
      async def on_ready(self):
          print(f'We have logged in as {self.client.user}')

      @commands.command() # this is for making a command
      async def hello(self, ctx): # a command that says Hello! (called using !hello)
          await ctx.send(f'Hello!')

      @commands.command() # this is for making a command
      async def ping(self, ctx):
          await ctx.send(f'Pong! {round(self.bot.latency * 1000)}')
          
  def setup(bot): # a extension must have a setup function
      bot.add_cog(Test(bot)) # adding a cog
  ```

## 6. Host your bot on repl.it
