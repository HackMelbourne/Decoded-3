## 1. Installing Modules

> 📝 NOTE: You can skip this step if you're using **Replit** as it
> can [automatically import](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/installing-packages#direct-imports) packages/modules
> it for you

* Now we're going to start writing the code for our bot!
* Before we begin creating the bot, we have to install a few modules

  <details>
  <summary><b>🧩 Hint: Accessing the Terminal in VS Code</b></summary>

* There are 2 ways to access the terminal in VS Code:
    1. using the shortcut ```Ctrl + Shift + ` ```
    2. Terminal > New Terminal

    * ![](vscode_access_terminal.gif)

  </details>

### ✅ Task: Install `discord.py` 2.0 

* `discord.py` is basically a set of tools which will allow us to control our bot with simple function calls.
* you can find the documentation for `discord.py` over [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#)
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U discord.py
  ```

### ✅ Task: Install `python-dotenv`

* `python-dotenv` is used to access our secret Discord token, which we will store in a `.env` file
* you can find the documentation for it over [here](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U python-dotenv
  ```
  
### ✅ Task: Install `asyncio`

* `asyncio` is used to write asynchronous code. Asynchronous code lets you execute a block of code without stopping (or blocking) the entire thread where the action is being executed.  
* you can find the documentation for it over [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U asyncio
  ```
  
### ✅ Task: Install `matplotlib`

* `matplotlib ` is a Python library used to create chart visualization[here](https://matplotlib.org/)
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U matplotlib
  ```
  
### ✅ Task: Install `os`

* `os` is a module providing functions to interact with the operating system [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U os
  ```
### ✅ Task: Install `emoji`
* `emoji` is a library allowing us to convert string to emoji [here] https://pypi.org/project/emoji/
* to install it, type this into your terminal:
  ```
  pip install -U emoji
  ```
> 🙋 **Ask for help**: Let us know if you run into any errors during installation and we'll try to help you out!

## 2. Enable Privilege Gateway Intents
 * Click onto this link and enable all the Priviledged Gateway Intents [here]https://discord.com/developers/applications/994103517436465212/bot
## 3. Create a main2.py file 
### ✅ Task: Create a main2.py file where we set up our bot. 
 * Import all the modules: asyncio, os, discord, load_dotenv, commands
   ```
    import discord
    import asyncio
    import os
    from discord.ext import commands
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
   ```
 * get Token from our .env file
   ```
    load_dotenv()
    TOKEN = os.getenv('TOKEN')
 * set up your bot 
   ```
    client = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents= discord.Intents.all()
   ```
   https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/api.html?highlight=commands%20bot#bots
   By having, discord.Intents.all() -> we let all bot knows that we enable all intent settings including: message_contents, members, presences, 
   
## 3. Create a cog for all your poll commands
### 📚 Outcome: What are we building for this task?
    
   <img width="262" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-18 at 11 41 38 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80389972/185410733-fcaf554b-ad0f-42c4-ab50-1db2ac15dec6.png">
### ✅ Task: Import essential modules 
 * `discord`, `asyncio`, `matplotlib`, `numpy` are modules we want to use to create a Poll Cog. So please import them: 
    ```
     import discord
     import asyncio
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
     import numpy as np
     from discord.ext import commands
    ```
### ✅ Task:
### ✅ Task: Create a constructor for the Poll Cog
* The Poll class is a subclass of `commands.Cog` class. 
* We need a constructor to create the Cog class. This constructor can be done by using `init` method. 
* The `init` method should take the `bot` attribute to store information about our bot. 
    ```
    def __init__(self, bot): 
        self.bot = bot
    ```
### ✅ Task: Get inputs from users before sending back the poll
 * We need to write a function `init_poll` allowing us to create a poll command. A way for us to set the command is using decorator @commands.command(aliases=["p"]) above declaration of the `init_poll` function. This means when a user type `!p` , we will have a poll command. 
 * However, that's not enough as a user need to give a poll question, time for the poll and options for others to vote => give 3 more attributes for `init_poll` include question, time, *options. 
    ```
    async def init_poll(self, ctx, question, time, *options): 
    ```
 * You can see we also need to have `self` and `ctx`. We need `self` because it is a function declared inside the class. We need `ctx` because when user type their `!p` command, having the `ctx` attribute will allow us to have access to the `Context` object of the command. 
 * <img width="977" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-17 at 8 14 25 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80389972/185095123-422fab2b-f2b0-4aa8-be60-17b31d73e731.png">
 * Next, we need apply a condition for our poll. You can customise how many options permitted for a poll. In this tutorial, there are maximum 3 options allowed. 
    ```
    if len(options) > 3:
      await ctx.send("The number of options cannot exceed the allowed limit")
    ```
 * you can notice that we are making use of ctx attribute to send back a message to the server. The data type of what is returned from ctx.send(...) is discord.Message. Here is more information about discord.Message: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#discord.Message
### ✅ Task: Send back an Embed as a poll
 * The discord bot has to send back the message to the server through `ctx.send(embed = Embed)`. 
 * A reason why we cannot send back a string like what we previous did is because our poll have a lot of information like time, question, given options. Hence, it is gonna messy if we put all of them into a string. 
 * Instead, make use of `embed attribute`. To do that, we first need to create an Embed object as following: 
    ```
    embed = discord.Embed(title = question,
                          description= f'Poll will end in {time} seconds :alarm_clock:. There are {len(options)} options:')
    ```
### ✅ Task: Use emoji module to convert strings to emojis and add fields and footer
  * To generate a list of 3 emojis: 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ , we need to generate a list of string and convert them to emojis
    ```
    tmp = [':one:', ':two:', ':three:']
    emojis = [emoji.emojize(e, use_aliases=True) for e in tmp]
    ```
  * Because 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ are recent emojis added to the emoji package. The old ones are usually faces: 😊, ☺️, etc . Hence DO NOT FORGET         `use_aliases=True` to convert strings to the package. 
  * Next, we want to add option fields. Run a for loop for it: 
    ```
     for i in range(len(options)):
        emo = emojis[i]
        embed.add_field(name = emo, value = options[i], inline = True)
    ```
  * Our poll looks much nicer if 3 choices are horizontally aligned. Hence DO NOT FORGET `inline = True`. 
  * Then, add another field for instruction: 
   ```
    embed.add_field(name="Instructions", value="React to cast a vote", inline=False)
   ```
  * Finally, add footer by following instruction below:

### ✅ Task: Add emojis to complete the poll and set time for users to vote
 * Add emojis for users to vote 
   ```
    for emo in emojis:
      await poll.add_reaction(emo)
    ```
 * Finally we can set the the time limit for the vote 
    ```
    await asyncio.sleep(int(time))
    ```
