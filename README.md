## About this repository
* This repository contains:
  * Participant Workbook
    * each workbook is made up of multiple Parts which are then made up of multiple **✅ Tasks** that the participant should complete, with **🧩 Hints** that help guide them in completing the Task, and **💡 Extensions** that are optional tasks that can be done if the participant has completed the Task ahead of schedule
    * The flow:
      1. host presents/teaches about Part 1
      2. participants follow the workbook to complete the ✅ Tasks in Part 1 of the workbook - participants who are ahead of the tasks can start do the 💡 Extensions and participants who are behind can use the 🧩 Hints or ask for help
      3. once most of the participants are done with Part 1, host starts presenting/teaching Part 2 and the cycle continues
  * Slides (if any)
  * Workshop Recordings
  * Code for the Discord Bot being created
