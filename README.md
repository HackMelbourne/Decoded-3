## 0. Create a Discord Account and Discord Server
* Before creating our bot, please make sure you create a Discord Account (it's free!) and a Discord Server to test your bot in
### Create a Discord Account

### Create a Discord Server
> üìù NOTE: Discord servers are sometimes refered to as **'guilds'** in some documentation (because some people confuse the word 'server' with computer servers üóÑÔ∏è XD)

## 1. Create an Application
* [Applications Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## 2. Installing modules: 
* Before we begin creating the bot, we have to install a few modules
* Install `discord.py`
  * discord.py is basically a set of tools which will allow us to control our bot with simple function calls.
  * to install it, type this into your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -U discord.py
    ```
* Install `python-dotenv`
  * `python-dotenv` is used to access our secret Discord token, which we will store in a `.env` file
  * to install it, type this into your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -U python-dotenv
    ```
* Install these following modules with the same command: os, selenium, emoji, asyncio, matplotlib, numpy
* Let us know if you run into any errors during installation!
## 3. Web Automation using Selenium

<summary><b>‚ùìWhy do we need to do web automation for this tutorial?</b></summary>
  Image a user wants to make a poll by typing this command on the already set up discord server - $p "what is your most favourite food?" 10 pasta pizza burger with 10 is the time limit for the poll. The discord bot will create a poll and it needs to generate emojis 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ for members to react to vote. However, fixed generated emojis like 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£ look too boring and they do not always suit the context; in this case, we are asking for food, so our poll will look much more appealing with those 3 emojis üçù üçï üçî. When we change the poll question, our bot should return emojis dynamically based on the context. For example, "which animal do you like most?" monkey cat tiger--> üêí üêà üêÖ should be returned. 
  SELENIUM WILL HELP US FETCH EMOJIS AUTOMATICALLY + DYNAMICALLY

* `.env` have several advantages:
1. They help different developers to keep their passwords separate from each other.
1. When using a VCS (GitHub), you can prevent your `.env` file from being uploaded to the internet, thus protecting all of your passwords.

To use a .env file, first make a `.env` file in the same folder as your code:
```python
# File name: .env
# Add comments with '#'
TOKEN=example.token.abc123
```
Then in your code file:
  ```python
  # ./main.py (after the other imports)
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  TOKEN = os.getenv('TOKEN')
  ```
