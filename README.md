## 0. Create a Discord Account and Discord Server
* Before creating our bot, please make sure you create a Discord Account (it's free!) and a Discord Server to test your bot in
### Create a Discord Account

### Create a Discord Server
> üìù NOTE: Discord servers are sometimes refered to as **'guilds'** in some documentation (because some people confuse the word 'server' with computer servers üóÑÔ∏è XD)

## 1. Create an Application
* [Applications Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## 2. Installing modules: 
* Before we begin creating the bot, we have to install a few modules
* Install `discord.py`
  * discord.py is basically a set of tools which will allow us to control our bot with simple function calls.
  * to install it, type this into your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -U discord.py
    ```
* Install `python-dotenv`
  * `python-dotenv` is used to access our secret Discord token, which we will store in a `.env` file
  * to install it, type this into your terminal:
    ```
    pip install -U python-dotenv
    ```
* Install these following modules with the same command: os, selenium, emoji, asyncio, matplotlib, numpy
* Let us know if you run into any errors during installation!
## 3. Creating a Bot and Adding it to your server

### Environment Variables
<details>
<summary><b>‚ùì What are environment variables?</b></summary>

When a program is run, it may need information from the operating system to configure its behaviour. This might include the operating system, current running folder, or more important things like passwords to various services (Discord here!). Basically, environment variables are variables/information about the environment its running on. They are a useful tool in providing information to your program, which is separate from your code. Developers commonly use `.env` files to specify these variables.

</details>

* `.env` have several advantages:
1. They help different developers to keep their passwords separate from each other.
1. When using a VCS (GitHub), you can prevent your `.env` file from being uploaded to the internet, thus protecting all of your passwords.

To use a .env file, first make a `.env` file in the same folder as your code:
```python
# File name: .env
# Add comments with '#'
TOKEN=example.token.abc123
```
Then in your code file:
  ```python
  # ./main.py (after the other imports)
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  TOKEN = os.getenv('TOKEN')
  ```
Try changing the content of your `.env` file and doing `print(TOKEN)`, what happens?
#### **üí° Challenge**
Can you try defining your own environment variable (besides `TOKEN`), and printing it to the console? How about printing the current operating system using only environment variables? (Will need some googling!)

Now that we have the token for our bot, let's add it to our server. Do do this, we will use the official [Discord Applications Page.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
