## 0. Cloning and setting up Lavalink

To get started with this lesson, you'll need the Hello foundations bot from the first workshop!
Clone it from here: https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Decoded-3
You can also download the repo as a zip and extract it to a folder.

<summary><b>‚ùì What is Wavelink and Lavalink?</b></summary>

Wavelink is a library that allows you to play music with discord.py using
the [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) library.

Lavalink is a server application which allows you to search and stream audio directly between a source and a destination
without too much overhead!

</details>

### 0.1 Downloading Java 13 ‚òï
To run Lavalink, you need to have Java 13. Nothing newer or older (although I've tested OpenJDK 11 and that worked too).
Download JDK 13 from this [link](https://jdk.java.net/archive/).

Here are some links for your specific platform:

* [Windows](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk13.0.2/d4173c853231432d94f001e99d882ca7/8/GPL/openjdk-13.0.2_windows-x64_bin.zip)
* [Mac](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk13.0.2/d4173c853231432d94f001e99d882ca7/8/GPL/openjdk-13.0.2_osx-x64_bin.tar.gz)
* [Linux](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk13.0.2/d4173c853231432d94f001e99d882ca7/8/GPL/openjdk-13.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz)

Extract it into the same folder as the repo you just cloned.

### 0.2 Downloading Lavalink ‚è¨

Then, download Lavalink from the following
URL: [Lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.4/Lavalink.jar)
([Source](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/tag/3.4))

You can also grab it from: [Here](https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Decoded-3/raw/music-bot/Lavalink.jar)

### 0.3 Downloading application.yml ‚öô

Finally, you'll need to grab an `application.yml` file, which will configure all the needed settings for Lavalink to
work.

Grab a copy of ours from here: [Forms](https://github.com/HackMelbourne/Decoded-3/blob/music-bot/application.yml)
and place it in the same folder as your Lavalink jar file.

### 0.4 Running Lavalink üåã

Now, you can run Lavalink by running the following command in the same folder as your Lavalink jar file:

```bash
./jdk-13.0.2/bin/java -jar Lavalink.jar
```

## 1. Installing Modules

* Before we begin creating the bot, we have to install a few modules

* Install wavelink üåä
    * Just simply type this in your terminal
  ```
  pip install wavelink
  ```

We're hoping you already have a basic hello bot set up from the first workshop!

* Now we need to start the bot by adding some import statement in our code.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import time

import discord
import requests
import wavelink
from discord.ext import commands
```

## 2. Setting up the join and leave commands

* We first need to set up a COG to put all of our code in:

```python
class MusicBot(commands.Cog):
    voice_clients = {}

    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(MusicBot(bot))
```

Make a new file called `musicbot.py` (or whatever you want really) and put it into the `cogs/` folder with the above
code.

You may notice an extra `voice_clients` dictionary. This is where we will store all the active song sessions we're
playing üéµ

* The first step for a music bot is being able to join the current voice channel. Let's make a command called `join`
  that does just that:

```python
@commands.command()
async def join(self, ctx: commands.Context):
    # We need to:
    # 1. Check if the user is in a voice channel
    # 2. Leave the current channel
    # 3. Join the channel and attach wavelink player
    # 4. Say that we joined
```

Let's implement these steps one by one:

1. We first check if the author of the message is in a voice channel. If they aren't, we send a reminder to join and
   stop
   there
     ```python
    if not ctx.message.author.voice:
        await ctx.send('You are not in a voice channel')
        return
    ```
2. Then we check if we're currently connected to a voice channel. If we are, we gotta leave
    ```python
    if ctx.voice_client is not None:
        await ctx.voice_client.disconnect()
    ```
3. If all is good, we grab the channel they're in and join the party ü•≥. It's important that we set wavelink as our audio
   source here, as that's where our music is coming from.
    ```python
    channel = ctx.message.author.voice.channel
    self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id] = await channel.connect(cls=wavelink.Player())
    ``` 
    * Take note of how we store the audio client in the `voice_clients` dictionary. This will be important later.
4. Finally, we text the user that we joined.
    ```python
    await ctx.send(f'Joined {channel}')
    ```

* We also need to make sure that users can ask our bot to leave. We can do this with the following:

```python
@commands.command()
async def leave(self, ctx):
    if ctx.guild.id in self.voice_clients:
        await self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id].stop()
        del self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id]
        await ctx.send('Left')
    if ctx.voice_client is not None:
        await ctx.voice_client.disconnect()
```

Let's break this down:

1. Let's check if we're in the voice channel to begin with in this guild. If we are, let's stop our player and delete
   our voice client
    * We also send a message to let the user know we left.
2. In case the bot was restarted, and the dictionary is empty, we do a simple disconnect as well.

## 3. Connecting to Lavalink

* There are quite a few steps to get our bot going. These include:

1. A logline to confirm that we've started up
2. Start the Lavalink server
3. Wait for the Lavalink server to be ready
4. Connect to the server using wavelink

```python

# Start the bot
@commands.Cog.listener()
async def on_ready(self):
    print('Logged in as')
    print(self.client.user.name)
    print(self.client.user.id)
    print('------')
    # Try start Lavafront server
    subprocess.Popen(["java", "-jar", "Lavalink.jar"])
    # wait for port to open
    while True:
        try:
            r = requests.get('http://localhost:2333')
            break
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
            print("Waiting for lavalink to go live...")
            time.sleep(1)
            continue

    async def connect_wavefront():
        await self.client.wait_until_ready()
        await wavelink.NodePool.create_node(
            bot=self.client,
            host='localhost',
            port=2333,
            password='youshallnotpass'
        )

    self.client.loop.create_task(connect_wavefront())


@commands.Cog.listener()
async def on_wavelink_node_ready(self, node: wavelink.Node):
    print(f'Connected to wavefront! ID: {node.identifier}')

```

## 4. Pausing and playing Music

Let's get to the fun part. Playing (and pausing) music!

```python
# To play the music  
@commands.command()
async def play(self, ctx, *, search: wavelink.YouTubeTrack):
    if ctx.guild.id not in self.voice_clients:
        # Join the user's voice channel
        await self.join(ctx)
    if ctx.guild.id not in self.voice_clients:
        return
    voice = self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id]
    await voice.play(search)
    embed = discord.Embed(
        title=voice.source.title,
        url=voice.source.uri,
        author=ctx.author,
        description=f"Playing {voice.source.title} in {voice.channel}"

    )
    embed.set_image(url=voice.source.thumbnail)
    await ctx.send(embed=embed)
```

3.1 We now need to make a function to stop the music
We can simply do in few steps.
```python 
@commands.command()
async def stop(self, ctx):
# Check if someone is in the voice channel and if some one is than stop the music and print a 'Stopped' text.
# If no one is in the voice channel than print 'Not in a voice channel' 
```
Let's implement these steps one by one:
   1. We need to check if the author of the message is in the voice channel. And if they are in the voice channel than print 'Stopped'. 
   ```python
      if ctx.guild.id in self.voice_clients:
         await self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id].stop()
         await ctx.send('Stopped')
   ```
   2. If no one is in the voice channel than just simply print 'Not in a voice channel'
   ```python
       else:
        await ctx.send('Not in a voice channel')
   ```
3.2 We now need to make a function to pause the music
We can simply do in few steps.
```python 
@commands.command()
async def pause(self, ctx):
# Check if someone is in the voice channel and if some one is than pause the music and print a 'Paused' text.
# If no one is in the voice channel than print 'Not in a voice channel' 
```
Let's implement these steps one by one:
   1. We need to check if the author of the message is in the voice channel. And if they are in the voice channel than print 'Paused'. 
   ```python
      if ctx.guild.id in self.voice_clients:
         await self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id].pause()
         await ctx.send('Paused')
   ```
   2. If no one is in the voice channel than just simply print 'Not in a voice channel'
   ```python
       else:
        await ctx.send('Not in a voice channel')
   ```
3.3 We now need to make a function to resume the music
We can simply do in few steps.
```python 
@commands.command()
async def resume(self, ctx):
# Check if someone is in the voice channel and if some one is than resume the music and print a 'Resume' text.
# If no one is in the voice channel than print 'Not in a voice channel' 
```
Let's implement these steps one by one:
   1. We need to check if the author of the message is in the voice channel. And if they are in the voice channel than print 'Resumed'. 
   ```python
      if ctx.guild.id in self.voice_clients:
         await self.voice_clients[ctx.guild.id].resume()
         await ctx.send('Resumed')
   ```
   2. If no one is in the voice channel than just simply print 'Not in a voice channel'
   ```python
       else:
        await ctx.send('Not in a voice channel')
   ```

Now when ever you will add '!paused' in discord it will pause the music and when you will add '!resumed' it will resume
the song again.
